# PanVK Kbase Android — Eden Switch Emulator Fork

> **Current fork scope: Eden Android / Nintendo Switch emulation only.**
>
> This fork is currently developed as a custom Vulkan driver for the
> **Eden Android Switch emulator** on Mali-G615/Kbase-CSF devices. It is not
> currently maintained as a general-purpose Winlator, Termux:X11, GameHub or
> desktop compatibility fork.

This repository is a fork of
[`GunaCharanTeja/panvk-kbase-android`](https://github.com/GunaCharanTeja/panvk-kbase-android)
and keeps the Mesa/PanVK and Kbase work from the upstream project. Eden-specific
integration, Android Native Buffer fixes, synchronization fixes and validation
are developed here by **LukeValen**.

## Eden compatibility

This driver currently requires a **specific experimental Eden build** with the
Mali custom-driver loading changes used during development. That Eden build is
**not distributed from this repository yet**.

Using this driver with a normal/public Eden build is not supported at this
stage and may result in startup failures, black output, presentation problems
or crashes.

Reference target:

- Poco X6 Pro / Dimensity 8300 Ultra
- Mali-G615 MC6, Pan arch v11, CSF
- Android Kbase interface at `/dev/mali0`
- Eden Android Switch emulator using the experimental Mali custom-driver path

## Current Eden work

Active integration work includes:

- loading PanVK through Eden's custom Vulkan driver path on Mali;
- MediaTek gralloc/mapper metadata handling;
- Android Native Buffer DMA-BUF discovery instead of assuming `native_handle_t->data[0]`;
- native-buffer import through `VK_ANDROID_native_buffer`;
- Android release-fence / `SYNC_FD` handling on Kbase;
- avoiding DRM-syncobj payload-copy logic on Kbase devices;
- swapchain/presentation diagnostics for black-screen and crash investigation.

The ANB DMA-BUF issue has been identified and fixed on the reference device.
Presentation synchronization and crash hardening are still under active
validation, so this fork should be treated as **experimental / development-only**.

See [`docs/EDEN-INTEGRATION.md`](docs/EDEN-INTEGRATION.md) for the current
technical status, requirements and known issues.

## Upstream foundation

The underlying project is a standalone patch/build layer around pinned upstream
Mesa that produces an open Mesa PanVK driver talking directly to Android's
proprietary `mali_kbase` kernel interface (`/dev/mali0`). The original project
supports broader consumers and use cases. This fork keeps that source lineage,
but its **current development target is Eden Switch emulation**.

## Reference device

- Phone: Poco X6 Pro (2311DRK48I, `duchamp`)
- SoC: MediaTek Dimensity 8300-Ultra (MT6897)
- GPU: Mali-G615 MC6, Pan arch v11, CSF frontend
- Kernel interface: `/dev/mali0` (`mali_kbase`)
- Observed GPU ID string: `Mali-G615 6 cores r1p3 0xB8A3`

## Supported GPUs

Only the **Mali-G615** (Mesa `PAN_ARCH` v11, CSF frontend; Arm's 4th
generation Valhall, announced 2022) is supported and validated, on the
reference device above. Other Mali GPUs (including G610/v10, G720/v12 and the
Bifrost/Valhall v7/v9 JM parts) have planned profiles or patch scaffolding but
are untested and unsupported. Arm's marketing generations (Utgard, Midgard,
Bifrost, Valhall 1st to 4th gen, 5th Gen, G1) and Mesa `PAN_ARCH` numbers are
different schemes; the full chronological GPU list, mappings, frontends and
upstream driver status are in
[`docs/MALI-GPU-ARCHITECTURES.md`](docs/MALI-GPU-ARCHITECTURES.md).

Status key:
- ✅ **Supported**: validated on a device.
- 📋 **TODO**: a profile exists in `profiles/` and the port is planned.
- ❔ **Possible, not tried**: Mesa has a backend for this arch, but no profile or device test exists here.
- ❌ **Not possible**: no PanVK (Vulkan) backend exists for the arch.

One row per Mesa arch. Each GPU carries its own status mark.

| Mesa arch | Arm family / generation | Frontend | GPUs (status per GPU) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| n/a | Pre-Utgard (fixed function) | n/a | ❌ Mali-55, ❌ Mali-110 | No programmable shaders |
| n/a (Lima) | Utgard | n/a | ❌ Mali-200, ❌ Mali-300, ❌ Mali-400 MP, ❌ Mali-450 MP, ❌ Mali-470 MP | GLES 2 only (Lima), no Vulkan |
| v4 | Midgard 1st to 3rd gen | JM | ❌ Mali-T604, ❌ T658, ❌ T622, ❌ T624, ❌ T628, ❌ T678, ❌ T720 | No PanVK backend |
| v5 | Midgard 3rd/4th gen | JM | ❌ Mali-T760, ❌ T820, ❌ T830, ❌ T860, ❌ T880 | No PanVK backend |
| v6 | Bifrost 1st/2nd gen | JM | ❌ Mali-G71, ❔ G72 | Mesa marks G71 unsupported; G72 experimental upstream |
| v7 | Bifrost 1st to 3rd gen | JM | 📋 Mali-G52, ❔ G31, ❔ G51, ❔ G76 | Profile `g52-v7-jm` (P25); needs the JM kbase path |
| v9 | Valhall 1st/2nd gen | JM | 📋 Mali-G57, ❔ G77, ❔ G68, ❔ G78, ❔ G78AE | Profile `g57-v9-jm` (P26); needs a v9 backend port and the JM kbase path |
| v10 | Valhall 3rd gen | CSF | 📋 Mali-G610, ❔ G310, ❔ G510, ❔ G710 | Profile `g610-v10-csf` (P24) |
| **v11** | **Valhall 4th gen** | **CSF** | ✅ **Mali-G615**, ❔ G715, ❔ Immortalis-G715 | G615 validated on Poco X6 Pro (Dimensity 8300). G715 and Immortalis-G715 share the same arch but are untested |
| v12 | 5th Gen | CSF | 📋 Mali-G720, ❔ G620, ❔ Immortalis-G720 | Profile `g720-v12-csf` (P24) |
| v13 | 5th Gen | CSF | ❔ Mali-G625, ❔ G725, ❔ Immortalis-G925 | No profile yet |
| v14 | 5th Gen, G1 series | CSF | ❔ Mali G1-Pro, ❔ G1-Premium, ❔ G1-Ultra | Experimental upstream; no profile yet |
| v15 (unconfirmed) | G2 series | CSF | ❌ Mali G2-Ultra NX, ❌ G2-Premium NX (rumoured), ❌ G2-Pro NX (rumoured) | Not in Mesa yet |

"Possible" means Mesa has code for the arch. It does not mean the arch works
here: each one still needs a kbase profile, its kbase frontend path (JM or
CSF) and device validation. The JM parts (v6, v7, v9) also need the
job-manager kbase path, because the current driver uses CSF only.

```sh
./scripts/fetch-mesa.sh
./scripts/apply-patches.sh --profile g615-v11-csf
./scripts/build-android.sh --profile g615-v11-csf
./scripts/validate-binary.sh --abi android dist/android-g615-v11-csf/libvulkan_panfrost.so

## Release policy

Tiers: `dev` (build only) < `alpha` (compute/offscreen) < `beta` (WSI +
app-loader on one profile) < `rc` (primary consumer) < `stable` (multi-device
+ soak). First Poco build is never `stable`. Releases are immutable; a patch
change creates a new release even if the Mesa SHA is unchanged.

### Current status

`g615-v11-csf-v0.1.0-beta.11` is the latest published tag (prerelease, Mesa
`5a07217f` plus the committed csf-v11 series up to 098). It fixes the
`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` on tiler heap OOM (098) and the memory blow-up from
per-pool TLS and eagerly committed prerast arenas (097). Need for Speed Most
Wanted stays at about 2.0 GB RSS and runs races at 40-44 fps with FEX Extreme.
The bundled driver in PanPlay 1.0.3 is beta.11. See the
[release page](https://github.com/zenithblue-oss/panvk-kbase-android/releases/tag/g615-v11-csf-v0.1.0-beta.11).
beta.10 (up to 096) made 32-bit
WoW64 games fast and correct. Placed maps now map the BO's dma-buf again at
the requested address (091) instead of a shadow copy. Need for Speed Most
Wanted (DXVK D3D9) went from 0.5 fps to 39-66 fps, with clean HUD and text.
It also adds GPU chunking of large and indirect prerast draws (094, 096),
the tessellation conditional-state fix (093), and the sample count for
attachment-less secondaries (095). Assets: Android and glibc drivers, `.adpkg` package, EMULATOR zip,
the test APK and screenshots. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and the
[release page](https://github.com/zenithblue-oss/panvk-kbase-android/releases/tag/g615-v11-csf-v0.1.0-beta.10).
beta.9 added `depthBounds` (092), `shaderOutputViewportIndex` from VS/TES
(090), per-viewport depth clamp/clip (089) and CSF event-memory sync words
(085).
beta.8 added X11 surfaces (`VK_KHR_xlib_surface`, `VK_KHR_xcb_surface`) for
Wine/Proton launchers that display through Termux:X11; the X11/XCB libraries
are loaded at runtime from the launcher's library path and are not bundled.
Presentation is a software copy (X11 `PutImage`).

`g615-v11-csf-v0.1.0-beta.3` (code commit
`fc8a759e7d1b2b8de01c0e96f1fdc5e3950ba1a3`, published 2026-09-19) and its
assets stay frozen by project policy. See
`validation/g615-v11-csf/BETA3-PUBLICATION-ADDENDUM.md`.

## Capability truth

Two separate sets are stored per release: `UPSTREAM_MATRIX_CAPABILITIES`
(from `docs/features.txt` of the exact Mesa checkout) and
`RUNTIME_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES` (from on-device `vulkaninfo`/probe). Only
runtime-tested capabilities may be used for compatibility claims. No fake
feature bits.

### Phase 5 feature workloads

All 13 target groups are natively exposed and passed real Poco X6 Pro
workloads. Enumeration alone is not counted as a test.

| Feature group | Status | Concise workload evidence |
|---|:---:|---|
| Descriptor indexing | **PASS** | Runtime array, partially-bound and variable-count descriptors; non-uniform sampled-image/storage-buffer indexing; checksum `123` |
| Timeline semaphore | **PASS** | GPU chain `1..64`, CPU wait/signal, CPU-to-GPU wait, final counter `66` |
| Dynamic rendering | **PASS** | `vkCmdBeginRendering`/`vkCmdEndRendering`; 1,154 triangle pixels; checksum `0x9a7f1b8fec90af07` |
| Synchronization2 | **PASS** | `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` and `vkQueueSubmit2`; timeline completion `67` |
| Buffer device address | **PASS** | Shader dereference at index 3; readback `0x2468ace0` |
| Push descriptors | **PASS** | `vkCmdPushDescriptorSetKHR` storage buffers; readback `0xb791f3dd` |
| Robust buffer access | **PASS** | Out-of-bounds index 64 from one bound uint returned `0x00000000` |
| Anisotropy | **PASS** | 4x anisotropy across 9 sampled formats; two deterministic runs |
| Wide lines | **PASS** | Width 5 rasterized 185 green pixels |

This table describes the beta.3 release. Since then `textureCompressionBC`
has been exposed on `feature/g615-dxvk-complete` through GPU compute decode
(G615 has no BC hardware); see the DXVK section below. Other unsupported
features are listed in [`docs/RUNTIME-FEATURES.md`](docs/RUNTIME-FEATURES.md).

## DXVK / vkd3d-proton compliance (G615)

### Current state (after csf-v11/092)

DXVK Native v3.1.1 on the Poco X6 Pro creates a D3D11 device at
**feature level 11_0** (`D3D11 HRESULT=0x00000000 feature_level=0xb000`);
D3D11 and D3D9 draw workloads pass. Every feature below runs on the GPU,
with no CPU fallback or simulation, and is exposed only after device proof.

| Feature | Implementation | Device proof (CTS Pass / Fail) |
|---|---|---|
| `geometryShader` | VS/GS run as compute on the GPU pre-raster path, 64 invocations (071) | geometry 193 / 0; instanced 20 / 0 |
| `tessellationShader` | VS, TCS, tessellator and TES as compute, GPU chunking | tessellation 526 / 0 |
| `VK_EXT_transform_feedback` | GPU capture kernel, 4 streams, counters, queries | transform_feedback 15793 / 0 (2 intermittent DeviceLost) |
| `textureCompressionBC` | GPU compute decode of BC1-7 | BC subset 1863 / 0; copy_and_blit 9620 / 0 |
| `shaderClipDistance`, `shaderCullDistance` | NIR lowering | device matrix 0 fail |
| `multiViewport` | 16 viewports, GS viewport index honoured (076) | device matrix 0 fail, scissor 88 / 88 |
| `fillModeNonSolid` | GPU kernel builds line/point primitives | 17/17 pixel-exact |
| `pipelineStatisticsQuery` | 049-054 | statistics_query 15374 / 0 |
| `VK_KHR_incremental_present`, `VK_EXT_swapchain_colorspace`, `VK_EXT_image_compression_control` | upstream backports | device probes 0 fail |
| `VK_EXT_multi_draw` | 072 | multi_draw 12704 / 0 |
| `VK_EXT_primitives_generated_query` | 073 | primitives_generated_query 75206 / 0 |
| `VK_EXT_memory_priority`, `VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory` | 069 | 224 / 0, 202 / 0; api.info 7799 / 0 |
| `alphaToOne` | 070 | alphaToOne 123 / 0 |
| `variableMultisampleRate` | 074 | variable_rate 504 / 0 standalone (tmp/cts/p5-vmsr/summary.txt); combined regression run (geometry + tessellation + transform_feedback.simple + variable_rate: 15955 cases, 6210 pass, 9745 NotSupported, 0 fail; source tmp/cts/r6-geo/status.txt) |
| `sync_fd` export | 075 (kbase KCPU queue) | sync_fd 1996 / 0 |
| `vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics` (v10-v12) | 078-082, vertex stage on the compute pre-raster path | atomic_operations `*_vertex*` 66 / 0; 12132-case tess/geometry/xfb/draw list 7940 / 0, 0 DeviceLost |
| per-viewport depth clamp/clip (beta.9) | 089, GS-selected viewports drawn as ordered runs | panvk-test `gs_viewport_depth` exact (no CTS) |
| `shaderOutputViewportIndex` from VS/TES (beta.9, v10/v11) | 090 | panvk-test `vs_viewport_index` 6/6 (no CTS) |
| `depthBounds` (beta.9, v10/v11) | 092, fragment-shader emulation | 2059 depth-bounds CTS cases: 1774 pass / 0 fail / 285 NotSupported; panvk-test `depth_bounds` 6/6 |

DXVK feature level 11_1 has not been re-checked on the beta.7 to beta.9
builds yet. The Android driver has X11 surfaces (beta.8), but under Proton 11
(i686 through wow64) Wine fails to create the Vulkan surface before the
driver is called, so DXVK presentation there is still blocked. `depthBounds`
lowered pipelines lose FPK, and `EarlyFragmentTests` shaders with depth writes
compare against the fragment's new depth (see the beta.9 release notes).
Still missing: `robustImageAccess2` (the vkd3d-proton device-create
blocker) and
sparse (FL12_0, `NO-GO` on Kbase). The X11 present teardown hang was seen once
under Xvfb only and is unverified on Android. Progress and TODOs:
[`worklogs/g615-dxvk/PROGRESS.md`](worklogs/g615-dxvk/PROGRESS.md). Roadmap:

### beta.3 evaluation (historical)

Machine-evaluated against stock tagged profiles. No fake feature bits.
Overall result: **FAIL**. DXVK 2.7.1/3.1.1 COMMON and vkd3d README hard
gates PASS; D3D9/D3D10/D3D11 profiles and vkd3d 2.14.1/3.0.1 device/profile
baseline FAIL. Stock DXVK/vkd3d smoke is BLOCKED (Android ICD is not a
legal host for those Windows binaries). CTS is BLOCKED.

At beta.3, still false (no spoofing): `geometryShader`, `tessellationShader`,
`fillModeNonSolid`, `multiViewport`, `shaderClipDistance`,
`shaderCullDistance`, `textureCompressionBC`, transform feedback,
`pipelineStatisticsQuery`, `robustImageAccess2`, sparse.

Proven on G615: `VK_EXT_robustness2` buffer + `nullDescriptor`,

At beta.3 the next blocker was `robustImageAccess2` (vkd3d 2.14.1/3.0.1
`DEVICE_CREATE`). It still is; geometry, fill, clip/cull and BC have since
landed (see Current state above).

### New extension workloads

These 16 beta.3 additions are exposed and workload-tested:

`VK_KHR_compute_shader_derivatives`, `VK_KHR_copy_memory_indirect`,
`VK_KHR_internally_synchronized_queues`, `VK_KHR_maintenance7`,
`VK_KHR_maintenance8`, `VK_KHR_maintenance9`, `VK_KHR_present_id2`,
`VK_KHR_present_wait2`, `VK_KHR_shader_constant_data`, `VK_KHR_shader_fma`,
`VK_KHR_shader_relaxed_extended_instruction`,
`VK_KHR_shader_untyped_pointers`, `VK_KHR_surface_maintenance1`,
`VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1`, `VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts`, and
`VK_GOOGLE_user_type`.

`VK_KHR_depth_clamp_zero_one`, `VK_KHR_pipeline_binary`, and
`VK_KHR_robustness2` are disabled and not exposed because required workload
proof is absent. `VK_GOOGLE_display_timing` is not exposed without a proven
Android timing implementation.

### beta.2 history

The immutable beta.2 tag exposed 12 instance and 166 device extensions (178
total). Its post-tag documentation commit is distinct from the tagged code as
recorded under [Current status](#current-status). Everything below is the
published beta.3 inventory generated from the canonical matrix.
